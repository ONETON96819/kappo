after first lauch of **kappo**. 

# how

**kappo** is a very simple [electron](http://electron.atom.io/) application.

It uses [fuzzy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fuzzy) to search for matches and [fuzzaldrin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fuzzaldrin) to sort them.

Application handling is done via the [appswitch](https://github.com/nriley/appswitch) tool.

# why

I have been using various application launcher software for many years now:

- [Quicksilver](https://qsapp.com/)
- [LaunchBar](https://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html)
- [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/)

All of them are very good.

But they also do way more than I need or want them to do. 

What I need:

- fast
- efficient fuzzy search, e.g. **ff** should find Firefox
- sleep and shutdown commands *TBD*

What I want:

- clean, minimal look
- focus on the application icons, not the names
- large and resizable application icons
- switch between apps (what the macOS **âŒ˜+Tab** does) when apps match
